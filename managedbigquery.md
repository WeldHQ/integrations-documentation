# What is BigQuery by Weld

We are offering a managed BigQuery by Weld free up til 1TB Stored Data for you to easily get started.

## How does it work?

We are setting up and managing a BigQuery Data Warehouse on Google Cloud for you to use freely through the Weld platform.

## What is the limit?

The usage limit is 1TB storage and 5TB queries per month.

## What happens when we hit the limit?

We will reach out to your through your user email to let you know we need you to take complete ownership of the BigQuery. 

We will transfer the project from our Google Cloud to your own Google Cloud. Weld will still be able to access the data warehouse, but you are now responsible for managing it through your Google Cloud Account. 

Our Data Team will help you set everything up and transfer it.
