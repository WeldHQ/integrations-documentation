# Things to be aware of

_This is still very much WIP_

## Properties

### Annoying extra stuff

- For Phone Number it must be put into [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)

### Hashing

You can either hash the properties yourself or you can let the integration hash them for you. But it's either all or nothing.

These properties need to be hashed

- First name
- Last name
- Street Address
- Email
- Phone Number

All the other properties can be left not hashed
